- clicks to trigger a "pressed down" state

## Reading

[Box Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#box-model) and [Visual Formatting Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html).

(Chapters 8 and 9 of [Cascading Style Sheets Level 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/))

Chapter 9 is a bit crazy, but very rewarding to read. Please be patient with it :)

### Questions

- What are _content box_, _margin box_, _border box_, _padding box_, respectively?
- What is _collapsing margin_ and what would you do to avoid it?
- What are _containing blocks_, _block-level elements_, and _block boxes_?
- What are _positioned elements_?
- Explain "normal flow" :)
