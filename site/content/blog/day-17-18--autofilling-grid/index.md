# Cards

Grids remind me of the old days when CSS was not as powerful as right now, some relatively easy concept took tricks to implement.
Like when we used to use a `1px` image to "stand the place" for a div such that we could set `width` and `height` for divs.

Now that we have grid, I'm not sure if I wish to think about how I would implement a stream gallery without it.

## Objectives

Let's create an image gallery like that :)

## Reading

Let's continue reading [CSS Grid Layout Module 1](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/), sections 4 - 6.
