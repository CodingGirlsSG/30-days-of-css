# Beating Heart

## Objectives

Let's deepen our knowledge about implementing the heart.
We'll work on a slightly different heart icon, like [this](https://codepen.io/wgao19/pen/qLrvaB).

Note a few changes:

- The heart is now white on a colored background
- Add shadow to the heart. You may try a few techniques such as [drop-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/drop-shadow), border, outline, [box-shadow](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-box-shadow/).
- (Optional) Add a beating animation
