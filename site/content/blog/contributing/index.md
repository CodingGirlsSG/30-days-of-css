# Contributing

We encourage you to contribute to this project in a number of ways!

## Writing Blog Posts

If you've learned something you wish to share across our peers, one good way is to write a post that explains what you've learned :)

This mindset is shared by many senior developers, including [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) who [tweeted](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1079214023881707520):

> If you feel like youâ€™ve learned something in the past few years I deeply recommend starting a blog, if only to catalog your thoughts.

To add your study notes to our collection, simply:

- link your blog post in our channel, or
- tweet your post with [our hashtag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/30DaysOfCSSGirls)

We'll assume this means you'd like to share your work with us and will add it under its corresponding topic.

If you'd like a reference to your own website, blog, etc, or have a screen name you'd like us to use in particular, please DM us to let us know.
Or else we'll just use whatever we could find :P

## Website

If you are interested in making open source contribution, you may look into our website!

All styling is written with pure CSS with an intentional focus on the fundamentals.
