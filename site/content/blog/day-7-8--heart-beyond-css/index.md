# Seeing the Limit of Drawing with CSS

We may soon feel obstructed trying to draw with CSS.
After all, CSS is not designed for drawing.
Consider [this design, Nintendo Switch](https://dribbble.com/shots/3348456-Nintendo-Switch) by [Louie Mantia](https://dribbble.com/mantia).

Is it possible to draw with CSS?

## Objectives

Turns out you can resemble it fairly nicely without much hassle, except perhaps for the heart with curled boundaries.
It was a lot of fun, though.
So please give it a try.
Give the heart a try, too.

[Just a hint](https://codepen.io/wgao19/pen/vvZoQW), as always.
