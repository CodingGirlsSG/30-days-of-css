# Seeing the Limit of Drawing with CSS

I was trying to implement this design [this design, Nintendo Switch](https://dribbble.com/shots/3348456-Nintendo-Switch) by [Louie Mantia](https://dribbble.com/mantia).
From time to time I'd hit a boundary and realize that CSS is not intended for drawing.
But the attempts are still fun.

Is it possible to draw with CSS?

## Objectives

Turns out you can resemble it fairly nicely without too much hassle.
So please give it a try.
Give the curled heart a try, too.

[Just a hint](https://codepen.io/wgao19/pen/vvZoQW), as always.
