# Seeing the Limit of Drawing with CSS

I was trying to implement this design [this design, Nintendo Switch](https://dribbble.com/shots/3348456-Nintendo-Switch) by [Louie Mantia](https://dribbble.com/mantia).

A few questions came up

- How do you draw the intersection near the handhelds?
- Do I really need to draw so many `<div>`s for the control buttons?
- How to draw the curled boundary of the heart?

In short.... are they even possible?

## Objectives

That Nintendo Switch design is so beautiful you shall not move your eyes away from it until you get it :P

[Just a hint](https://codepen.io/wgao19/pen/vvZoQW), as always.
