# CSS Stamp Edges

What's your inner voice when handed a design that contains stampe edges?
I'd say I'm as obssessed as the designers about it.
Every time I see a design like that, a coupon, an envelope, or perhaps just a stamp by itself.

> I want to do it with CSS.

Is where my heart says.

This topic is beautiful. As [a simple dribbble search](https://dribbble.com/search?q=stamp) gets you the idea. Here are some examples:

And what about [a coupon](https://dribbble.com/search?q=coupon) (most of the the time, a coupon has only two sides that has the punched holes)

## Reading

We've been creating hearts using pseudo-elements for three challenges now. Let's read a bit into that today.

- [Pseudo-Elements Module Level 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-pseudo-4/)

### Questions

- What is the difference between pseudo-element selectors and pseudo-selectors?
- What are three types of pseudo-element selectors?
- What is the criterion for pseudo-element selectors to show up?
