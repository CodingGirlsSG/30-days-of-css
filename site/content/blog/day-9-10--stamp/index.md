# CSS Stamp Edges

What's your inner voice when handed a design that contains stamped edges?
I'd say I'm as obssessed as the designers about it.
Every time I see a design like that, a coupon, an envelope, or perhaps just a stamp by itself.

> I want to do it with CSS.

Is where my heart says.

There are a number of ways to do this.
Let's have this kind of fun together.

## Objectives

Turn one of your favorite images to a stamp, like [this](https://codepen.io/wgao19/pen/vvrbeP).
