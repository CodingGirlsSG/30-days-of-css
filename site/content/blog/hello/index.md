30 Days of CSS is a [#30DaysOfCSS](https://twitter.com/search?q=%2330daysofcss) challenge brought by CodingGirls.

## What You Need

- A love of creating beautiful pages on the web.
- Complete the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)'s [Basic HTML & HTML5](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/) and [Basic CSS](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css) curriculum.

## Get Ready to...

Implement beautiful designs into web pages using CSS.

The sources of designs we'll use include [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com) designs, lovely patterns we find in real life, and any designs you want to implement on your own!

We'll present a challenging task for you to work on every other day. And the _other_ every other day we'll be reading [CSS Specs](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2018/) alongside the techniques we've used.
This will also be the day when you'll create your own task, be it to implement some design of your imagination, or writing a blog post about what you've learned to recap and share your knowledge.

We've designed the program this way because we realize reading the specs may have been the most effective way of learning CSS!
It gives you a rooting perspective -- browser implementation. You are free to trace back to its origin, to understand the challenge and motivation of each CSS feature. And it keeps you updated to the most recent development.

Is there even a better deal?

Of course, then, you'll have to work hard for it. Because reading the specs may be a bit daunting at first.
My leader said it's his sleep time reader - -.

But once you've read a few sections and have understood the basics, you'll start to enjoy it.
Because the feeling of understanding the principles inside-out is simply... Amazing!

We'll keep you accompanied, cuz we're striving to read them, too!!!
We'll also be posting our study notes. We'll focus on intuition. Hopefully that'll pave the way for a more thorough understanding of CSS.

So buckle up!
