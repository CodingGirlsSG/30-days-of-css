# Water Wave

Remember that hypnotic background we created [on day 11](../day-11-12--repeating-gradient)?
Let's animate it!

## Objective

Implement the animation for [Hypnotic Background](https://dribbble.com/shots/2859124-DCX-Hypnotic-Background).

Original design: [DCX - Hypnotic Background](https://dribbble.com/shots/2859124-DCX-Hypnotic-Background) by [Nick DiMatteo](https://dribbble.com/ndimatteo).
