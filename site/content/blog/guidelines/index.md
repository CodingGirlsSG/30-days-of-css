## Works

On alternate days we'l pick up a challenge to implement.
We'll provide a "sample" challenge, but you're free to choose your own.
The ones we've chose are mostly from [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/). Others some cool designs we find in real life.

### Completion Checklist

- Create a [Codepen](http://codepen.io) for your implementation, add to our collection [30 Days of CSS Girls](https://codepen.io/collection/XJJoBY/).
- If you're implementing someone else's design, put a reference to the original design. You may do so in your CodePen's description or comment in the code.
- If you'd like to tweet and share, feel free to tag [#30DaysOfCSSGirls](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%2330DaysOfCSSGirls). And once again don't forget to reference original designer. It's a good way to gain exposure, too :)
- Code review a challenge from another participant.

### Code Review

Normally code reviews are done using tools that serve the context.
Since we're using CodePen for its amazing simplicity for CSS projects, we will not enjoy the convenience of code review tools.
Nevertheless, code review is a practice that both improves code quality and provides a chance for you to learn from your peers.

Let's practice code review together:

- If there's something you don't understand, you may ask the author what it is intended to do
- You may remind the author of the limits of certain implementation if you observe
- You may share alternative implementations

## Reads

Every other day we'll slow down on coding and take time to read CSS specifications.
You are encouraged to create simple CodePens to try out the things you read from the specs.

The specs we'll read will be a select from [CSS Snapshot 2018](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2018/).

What is _CSS Snapshot 2018_?

> ... collects together into one definition all the specs that together form the current state of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) as of 2018.
